									<h2>Tak3n</h2>
									<p>The conquest to the greatest rescue mission in the universe.</p>
								</header>
								<hr />
								<p>Zayah, the only daughter of the King of Riznor, Jarvan III, used heartbroken when her father was assassinated by the usurper, Reneton and then entire kingdom of Riznor joined her in mourning. However, bent on having revenge and justice, she gathered an alliance and marched her armies against the crown. After a month of fighting, the last remnants of her forces were crushed on the Battle of Bothawui. However, Reneton knew that by killing her, he wouldn't be able to win the heart of the people of Riznor. So, he showed mercy and cast her essence out into wild space so she could never form a rebellion again and assumed his position as the King of Riznor. Zayah floated in space for years till she came upon Earth and inhabited the body of a dying girl. Her family was amazed and surprised and yet happily accepted her back into their lives. They didn't know Zayah was the actual person in that body and that way Zayah got to start a new life all over again. She became close with her sister, Nancy, and soon they became inseparable.
								</p>
								<p>
									One night, walking back home through an alley, they were ambushed and both of them got abducted. When Zayah next woke up, she saw a friend who she hadn't seen since the days of the rebellion, Garen. He tells her that he was able to come and save her but they took her sister somewhere else. According to him, Reneton several of his generals scouring the universe and one of them, Nautilus, came to Earth. They have been searching for Zayah to capture the last hope of Riznor as the people still don't approve of Reneton's rule and have been waiting ever since for the true heiress to return. So, they follow the trail, killing Nautilus's minions and following portals one after the other till they finally arrive at the cave where Nautilus appears to have taken up residence. We see our sister there locked up and break her out. Garen says that he'll get her to safety but it would be wise for us to stay behind and kill Nautilus or he will keep on coming after them. Zayah stays there and waits for Nautilus and defeats him after a long and tedious battle so that she can return home safely to her new family.
